Microsoft Windows<br>
Microsoft created the Windows operating system in the mid-1980s. There have been
many different versions of Windows, but the most recent ones are Windows 10 (released
in 2015), Windows 8 (2012), Windows 7 (2009), and Windows Vista (2007). Windows
comes pre-loaded on most new PCs, which helps to make it the most popular operating system in the world.
Linux<br>
Linux (pronounced LINN-ux) is a family of open-source operating systems, which
means they can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world. This is
 different from proprietary software like Windows, which can only be modified by the
 company that owns it. The advantages of Linux are that it is free, and there are many different distributions—or versions—you can choose from.
 According to StatCounter Global Stats, Linux users account for less than 2% of global
 operating systems. However, most servers run Linux because it's relatively easy to customize.
 macOS<br>
 macOS (previously called OS X) is a line of operating systems created by Apple. It comes
 preloaded on all Macintosh computers, or Macs. Some of the specific versions include Mojave (released in 2018), High Sierra (2017), and Sierra (2016).
 According to StatCounter Global Stats, macOS users account for less than 10% of
 global operating systems—much lower than the percentage of Windows users (more
 than 80%). One reason for this is that Apple computers tend to be more expensive.
 However, many people do prefer the look and feel of macOS over Windows.
 android<br>
 Android is an OS created by Google® for use on mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. It's
 available on devices made by a variety of manufacturers, giving you more choices of device style and
 pricing. Also, with the Android OS, you can customize your device in many ways.
 freebsd<br>
 FreeBSD is a modern operating system for desktops, laptops, servers,
 and embedded systems with support for a large number of platforms.
 FreeBSD is used by companies, Internet Service Providers, researchers, computer 
 professionals, students and home users all over the world in their work, education and recreation.
